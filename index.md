## Short Bio

I am a Research Engineer at Genmo.ai, working with [Ajay Jain](https://www.ajayjain.net/) and [Paras Jain](https://www.parasjain.com/) on video generation. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in [Computer Vision and Machine Learning group](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/) 
at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/),
advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele/).
My research involves close collaborations with [Dr. Dengxin Dai](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/team/members/dengxin.html).
During my PhD, I was a student researcher at Google Zurich, working with [Dr. Yongqin Xian](https://xianyongqin.github.io/),
[Dr. Xiaohua Zhai (DeepMind)](https://sites.google.com/view/xzhai),
[Dr. Alexander A. Kolesnikov (DeepMind)](https://kolesnikov.ch/),
and [Prof. Federico Tombari](https://federicotombari.github.io/).
Prior to this, I obtained my Masterâ€™s degree from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).


<!-- My research goal is to build intelligent machines that can perceive and understand the world as humans,
with a special focus on **learning representations** of our visual world.
So far, my primary focus has been on tackling it through a data-centric lens. That is, **how can we learn good representations from imperfect data?**
Moving forward, I am excited to explore the following research questions:
- **How can we learn robust representations that generalize well across environments?** 
- **What are the useful inductive biases for enhancing representation robustness? How can we effectively incorporate them into the model?** -->
